LZW Encoding and Decoding for Image:

LZW, which is short for, Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding, is an image compression technique. It assign fixed length code words to variable length sequences of source symbols, rather than individual source symbols. Unlike other techniques like Huffman coding, this method requires no prior knowledge of the probability of occurrence of the symbols to be encoded.
